# SySCoRe - Models


# Continuous state models
- LTI model ( Class: LinModel)
- Non linear model ( Class: NonlinModel)

Classes include properties for the regions and atomic propositions
All classes aso have a method f_det to compute the deterministic transition. 
State and input bounds are given as polytopes

# Finite Markov decision processes
TODO:
- Build a class to simplify the simulations
to be added
+ Deterministic labelling
+ Nondeterministic Labelling
 
  
TODO:
- add method x2label to all models
- add deterministic transition map
- add MDP class
