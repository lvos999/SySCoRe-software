# Why Unit Test?

Unit tests are essential for robust code. It ensures that bugs can be caught 
quickly. This is true for the initial development and for maintenance.

# Responsibilities for Developers

* unit test everything (if feasible)
* keep the tests short
* the tests need to be fully automatic with no user input
* test your code not built in MATLAB functionality (they are already tested)
* any of the test in the folder (prefixed by t) can be used as examples
